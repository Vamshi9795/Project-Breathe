# Project-Breathe
The aim of the Virtual Reality (VR) project is to educate users about the causes of CO2 emissions and how an innovative solution called artificial photosynthesis can reduce their impact on the environment. Users embark on a walk-through journey in a VR environment that depicts various scenarios such as factories, cars, and wildfires, demonstrating how human activities contribute to the increase of CO2 emissions in the environment. Users can interact with the environment, explore various objects, and gather information on the effects of each object on the environment.

Towards the end of the VR path, users are presented with a puzzle that requires them to drag three text objects: "research," "funding," and "approval" to three corresponding boxes, providing insight into the essential steps required to bring innovative solutions such as artificial photosynthesis into reality.

Once the puzzle is complete, an artificial photosynthesis device is presented, accompanied by a detailed description. Users can activate the device by clicking on a button, initiating the conversion of CO2 in the environment to O2. The project aims to provide an engaging and innovative way to educate users on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions, promoting sustainable living, and understanding the steps required to implement innovative solutions such as artificial photosynthesis to reduce the impact of CO2 on the environment.
